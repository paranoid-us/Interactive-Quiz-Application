## The **DevMuskan Quiz App** is an interactive and lively browser-based quiz application that is built with the help of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It is a fun and engaging method for administering quizzes on web development topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

The program starts with a greeting page. On the click of **"Start Quiz,"** the quiz page opens up with a 60-second countdown timer on each question. The quiz is shown one question at a time in multiple-choice format, with instant visual and audio feedback for correct or incorrect answers using **custom sound effects** (`correct.mp3` and `wrong.mp3`).

Every question has a timer, and when time is over, the app automatically marks the correct answer and continues with the user. Upon finishing all questions, a final score summary is provided to the users. If all answers are correct, a **confetti animation** rewards the perfect score with the Canvas Confetti library.

The look is made **responsive and visually appealing**, with:

* A **gradient animated background**
* A **Glassmorphism-style quiz container**
* Smooth transition and hover effects on buttons
* Real-time update of scores and feedback
* **Watermark branding** (\"Made by DevMuskan\")

The questions are stored in a JavaScript array to make it easy to customize or add more. Semantic HTML and tidy modular JavaScript make the app easy to maintain and user-friendly.

This quiz app is a perfect DOM manipulation practice project, use of timers, event handling, and user interaction with JavaScript, all within the framework of modern-day UI/UX design principles with the help of pure CSS.

üéØ Features
‚úÖ Interactive Quiz Flow
Users begin the experience from a start screen which introduces the quiz and prompts them to begin. Once the user clicks the Start Quiz button, the app switches to the quiz interface. Each quiz round includes a single question at a time, presented with multiple-choice options that the user can select.

‚è±Ô∏è Timer-Based Questions
Each question starts with a 60-second countdown timer. The timer is prominently displayed and updates in real-time. If the user fails to answer the question in time, the quiz auto-selects the correct answer and displays appropriate feedback, preventing any delay or manual input requirements.

üîä Real-Time Feedback with Sound Effects
Upon selecting an answer, the app provides immediate feedback by highlighting the correct and incorrect options using distinct color gradients. It also plays sound effects‚Äîcorrect.mp3 for right answers and wrong.mp3 for incorrect ones‚Äîadding an audio dimension to user engagement.

üéä Confetti Celebration
To further enhance the gamified experience, a confetti animation is triggered at the end of the quiz if the user answers all questions correctly. This is powered by the Canvas Confetti library, which generates vibrant and colorful particles to celebrate the achievement.

üß† Question Bank
The questions are stored in a JavaScript array named questions, with each object consisting of a question string, a list of multiple-choice answers, and the correct answer. This structure allows easy scalability for adding or modifying quiz content.

üì± Responsive Design & Animations
The app is built with modern CSS techniques, including gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism-style containers, hover animations, and keyframe transitions. It is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring usability across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

üåà Theming & Aesthetic Appeal
The background features a dynamic gradient animation that cycles through multiple soft colors, creating a subtle yet captivating visual. The quiz container has a translucent blur effect with soft shadows, rounded corners, and drop shadows, giving the app a polished and futuristic feel.
